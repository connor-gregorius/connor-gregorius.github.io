<!-- Connor Gregorius -->
<p style="font-family:fantasy;"> Our adventure starts with the observable universe, here are some interesting facts and details about it:</p>
<!--List stating facts about the observable universe--> 
<ul>  
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">We aren’t limited by our technology as to why we can only see what we see so far, basically it's just because any signals given out by anything outside of the observable universe couldn’t have reached us yet</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">It's diameter is roughly 93 <em>billion</em> light years in length</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">It's mass is roughly 10^50 tons</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">There are at least 2 <em>trillion</em> galaxies in the observable universe</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">All currently observable objects will eventually appear to freeze in time, while emitting progressively redder and fainter light due to the universe expanding</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">Light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 62 billion light years) will never reach Earth</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">Some objects in the universe will <strong>never</strong> be observable, as they are travelling away from Earth faster than the speed of light</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">it is estimated that the there are between 10^78 to 10^82 atoms in the known, observable universe</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">Though well known, the universe itself is constantly expanding, but what some may not know is that it's rate of growth (acceleration) is also increasing</li>
<li style="font-family:fantasy;">96% of the universe is made up of substances that cannot be seen or easily comprehended.</li>
</ul>

    <p style="font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">Traveling faster than the speed of light, we start from the observable universe, a region of the universe comprising all matter that can be observed from Earth. Traveling past many sites, and end up at the Local Group, which is a a group of galaxies that the Milky Way Galaxy is a part of. We look at all the galaxies here and notice a certain galaxy in particular: <strong>the Milky Way Galaxy </strong>.</p>

<p style="font-family:cursive;">We travel into the Local Group to get a closer look at each galaxy. As we are looking, someone notes the interstellar medium, the matter and radiation that exists in the space between the star systems in a galaxy.</p>

    <p style="font-family:serif;">We went inside the Milky Way and eventually found our very own solar system. We could see Mars, Jupiter, and all the other planets. Along with all of them we finally found the thing we've been looking for, Earth.</p>
